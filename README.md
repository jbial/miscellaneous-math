## Motivation
This repository contains an on-going collection of notebooks containing bite-sized chunks of math that I find interesting.


As a note to myself, some random topics I want to add to this repo in the future include:
* DFT, FFT
* Dual numbers
* Compressed sensing
* SVD & power iteration
* Sampling methods
* Convex hull
* Random walks
