## Motivation
This repository contains an on-going collection of notebooks containing bite-sized chunks of math.

I'll restrict the content to general topics that have wide-ranging applications rather than domain-specific algorithms.

## TODO

* ADD DOCUMENTATION

As a note to myself, some random topics I want to add to this repo in the future include:
* DFT, FFT
* Dual numbers
* Compressed sensing
* SVD & power iteration
* Sampling methods
* Optimization via simulated annealing
* Random walks
